This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Journal of Orthoptera Research](https://jor.pensoft.net/).

The **Journal of Orthoptera Research** (JOR) is the open access, peer-reviewed journal of the Orthopterists’ Society. JOR publishes work on the insect order Orthoptera and its allies, Blattodea, Mantodea, Phasmatodea, Grylloblattodea, Mantophasmatodea and Dermaptera. Its goal is the dissemination of ideas and insights arising from the study of these insects. Papers published cover a range of biological and evolutionary studies of these insects including their diversity, phylogeny, conservation, and the control and management of pest species. Acceptable studies fall within the disciplines of cytology, biological control, morphology, physiology, parasitology, endocrinology, behavior, ecology, systematics, biogeography, and taxonomy.

The journal encourages comprehensive and synthetic papers and those utilizing modern techniques. Case studies of interesting phenomena are also appropriate, as long as they are contextualized in terms of their significance to orthopterology and entomology in general. Alongside original research, JOR also publishes review articles, short communications, and articles focusing on policy and management of Orthoptera. Two issues are published biannually, and members of the Orthopterists’ Society publish free.
